Code Quest: The PyTome of Knowledge is a mobile game-based learning application for Android devices designed to teach IT learners the fundamentals of programming using the Python programming language.

Code Quest combines mobile accessibility with gamification to improve programming education. The game incorporates Python teachings into a 2D top-down role-playing adventure set in the fictional world of Binarius, blending storytelling with hands-on coding lessons and challenges.


Developed and currently being maintained and updated by Kurt Robin Colonia.

#### Warning!
This project is currently undergoing a major refactor. A majority of the scripts I've written for this game were rushed in order to meet project deadlines and are thus mostly low quality codes. I intend to revamp the following:

1. Completely migrate the game's backend from Firebase to Supabase (Viva La [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)!)
2. Rewrite a majority of the game's base functionalities and systems
3. Run my own deployment of the [CodeX API by Jaagrav](https://github.com/Jaagrav/CodeX-API), since Jaagrav's deployment has remained down for months now.

	- Doing this will allow me to not rely on jDoodle, which uses a credit-based system.
4. Improve upon current game assets (user interface, tilemaps, the map itself, sfx, music, etc.)
5. Add content I previously was not able to implement due to strict time constraints. (More characters, coding questions, locations)
