Namdal: {user_var.username}, our town's little apprentice scribe! I heard from your mother that it's your first day at the [b]Academe[/b]...
Namdal: Which means, you don't have your [b]identification seal[/b] yet!
Namdal: I can make your identification seal, but first I'll have to teach you how the magic of Python can be harnessed. This'll give you a head start in learning!
Namdal: So, let's start with that journal of yours. That right there is the same journal your father used when he was a scribe in the Order. Go ahead and open it!
