Ishi,

Writing this in advance before I send you a message. If by any chance you stumble upon
this very project and read this exact file, I wanted to tell you that you've been one
of the driving forces as to how I was able to accomplish this project.

Actually, you've been the main reason why I decided to smarten up and get my learning
back in line. I've wanted to improve myself and prove to myself that I can indeed work
hard enough to make a change in my life, and I did!

Hope to talk to you soon!

- Kurt
