* ------------------------------------------------- INTRODUCTION TO README_CICS.TXT ------------------------------------------------- *

											Code Quest - The PyTome Of Knowledge.
								A Capstone Project developed by Kurt Colonia and Dominic Ramos
												4 BSIT-3, A.Y. 2024-2025

			This is a simple ReadMe text file dedicated to guide you along the folder structure of this project.

	We recommend that you use Notepad or Notepad++ when viewing this file. VS Code tends to break the formatted ASCII art above!

* ------------------------------------------------- FOLDER STRUCTURE OF THE PROJECT ------------------------------------------------- *

'.godot' Folder (DO NOT DELETE) -> A folder generated by Godot. This is pretty much where the project settings are stored.

'addons' Folder -> Holds all of the third-party community-made addons used for the project, such as Dialogic 2.0 for
				   the Dialogue system of the game, Debug Menu and Monitor Overlay for Performance tracking, and etc.

'assets' Folder -> Where all in-game elements such as the UI and game sprites are located. Each asset is assigned to
				   the proper folder (i.e. UI elements are inside 'ui' folder, Player-related assets are under 'player' folder)

'scenes' Folder -> Where all Godot scenes are stored. Each scene stores menus, game levels, objects for the game, etc.

'scripts' Folder -> Where all scripts used within the game are stored. Like both 'assets' and 'scenes' folder, each GDScript file
					is stored wherever they are relevant (i.e. Firebase GDScript is stored within the 'backend' folder, etc.)

Other tham the provided folders above, there are also a couple of loose files found outside of these folder/directories such as:

'CodeQuest_GD4.code-workspace' -> A VS Code workspace used during the development of the game. Loads up VS Code with the game's
								  folders/directories already opened for viewing/editing.

'export_presets.cfg' -> Export Configurations used by Godot when exporting the game to Android Devices and Windows (Windows Version
						is buggy, since game is only intended for Mobile Devices in the portrait screen orientation).

'projet.godot' -> Godot's engine configuration file. DO NOT TOUCH NOR DELETE, DOING SO WILL BREAK THE PROJECT!!

* ------------------------------------------------------ ACCESSING THE PROJECT ------------------------------------------------------ *

https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.3/

If you are planning on accessing this project and viewing/editing the project, Please ensure that you have the following software:

1. Godot 4.3 Stable: The Game Engine used to develop the project. Through Godot, you will be able to access all scenes and scripts
					 used within the game.

2. Visual Studio Code, preferrably v1.89.0 or higher: Connected to Godot for script editing and creation. The reason we used VS Code
													  was due to it's modularity with community-made plugins.
3. Paint.net, preferrably v5.0.13 or higher: Used for photo manipulation and asset creation.
4. Aseprite, preferrably v1.3.7 or higher: Used for creation of pixel art assets.
5. Android SDK, preferrably Level 21: Used in exporting the game to Android devices.

Once you have all of the indicated software above, please ensure that your Desktop Computer/Laptop has a stable internet connection.
This ensures that, during debugging (whether it be on your PC or on an emulator/actual phone), the game will be able to run as intended.
